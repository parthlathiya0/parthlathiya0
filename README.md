### Hi there üëã

I'm an aspiring data scientist having 8-9 months of experience working on `complex data sets, finding patterns, co-relations, typos, handling missing values/outliers, etc .` by applying different filters with 
tools such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

I've worked with **Networking sector** and **Petroleum sector** by applying `Machine Learning Algorithms`, `Statistical Methods` and `Insightful Visualisations` along with some `Image Processing` stuff.

I'm can also perform `Feature Engineering` and `Feature Selection` on data while preforming `predictive modeling` to avoid Dimentionality problems and avoid Model confusion. I also know which Machine Learning Algorithms(currently known to me) to apply to which kind of data so that we can get the best benefit instead of just trying out all the models and picking up the best one. I have also performed `Model Tuning` and can choose apt `Evaluation Metric` for different business problems.

**EXPERIENCE üèã**
- DATA SCIENCE 
  - Data science related end to end cleaning, engineering, selecting, modelling, evaluating and redesigning for better precision and recall.
  - Anamoly detection in industrial applications like petroleum industry, diamond industry, rest comming up...
  - Basic NLP (Natural language processing).

- AI
  - Computer Vision projects specifically object detection and tracking in real time on client side(browser) as well as on server side with camera integration. Integrated this services at a poultry farm and one integrating a real time intelliget survellience AI at public place.
  - Experience in Data Selection, Modelling and improving performance.
  - Using the most accurate data, tools and architectures.
  
`Reach out if you have an application in mind. Any field is suitable üëçüèª`


**I'm actively working as a Jr. Data Scientist working on Computer Vision AI Projects**
## Looking forward to collaborate on intesting Ideas ü§©
