### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring data scientist having 8-9 months of experience working on `complex data sets, finding patterns, co-relations, typos, handling missing values/outliers, etc .` by applying different filters with 
tools such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

I've worked with **finance sector** and **oil & gas sectors** by applying `Machine Learning Algorithms`(by sklearn) and `Statistical Methods` with some `Image Manipulation techniques`(sobel) provided by OpenCV.

I've also worked on `data preprocessing` using Pandas, manipulating from it's raw untidy form into tidy data using pandas library.
**I'm looking out for a job as a Data Scientist**
