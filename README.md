### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring data scientist having 8-9 months of experience working on `complex data sets, finding patterns, co-relations, typos, handling missing values/outliers, etc .` by applying different filters with 
tools such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

I've worked with **Networking sector** and **Petroleum sector** by applying `Machine Learning Algorithms`, `Statistical Methods` and `Insightful Visualisations` along with some `Image Processing` stuff.

I'm can also perform `Feature Engineering` and `Feature Selection` on data while preforming `predictive modeling` to avoid Dimentionality problems and avoid Model confusion. I also know which Machine Learning Algorithms(currently known to me) to apply to which kind of data so that we can get the best benefit instead of just trying out all the models and picking up the best one. I have also performed `Model Tuning` and can choose apt `Evaluation Metric` for different business problems.

**I'm actively looking for a job opportunity as a Data Scientist**
